# Olist E-commerce data analysis in MySQL

In this project, I used the Olist e-commerce dataset on Kaggle to explore the information it provides.

## Motivation

E-commerce has changed how we shop without limitations of time and space. I am interested in how e-commerce operates differently in consumer culture.
